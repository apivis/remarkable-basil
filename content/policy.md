This is the privacy policy for APIVIS and associated apps. Everything that we do is guided by our values â€“ including our editorial approach and how we use data.

We use your personal data for many reasons, from understanding how our users engage with our media platform to informing our marketing and advertising. Ultimately, this allows us to publish the content that you read on our sites and apps.

These are the main reasons why we collect and use data about our users:

- To show you content that is relevant to you and to improve your experience on our site

- To provide the services you sign up for, such as our global cloud platform for Node-RED

- To carry out marketing analysis and send you communications when we have your permission, or when permitted by law.
