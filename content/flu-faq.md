### FAQ

What types of medicinal mushrooms are there?

**[Chaga](https://www.enviromedica.com/learn/prebiotics/#text-sec-7)**

[](<>) Chaga has been used by traditional cultures for its health benefits, for hundreds of years. It grows high up on the bark of birch trees in the Eastern U.S. and Canada. This mushroom presents as a hardened, blackened, crusty formation, with the appearance of a bursting tumor on the trunk of a birch tree. Chaga’s most important components, betulinic acid and melano-glucan complexes are derived from the bark of the birch trees the fungus grows on. Chaga is traditionally used as a tea and is revered for its anti-cancer and digestive health benefits.[3](https://www.enviromedica.com/wellness/benefits-medicinal-mushrooms/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-4261)

[](<>)[](<>) In his review of recent research, Hastings[4](https://www.enviromedica.com/wellness/benefits-medicinal-mushrooms/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-4261)found that Chaga demonstrated hypoglycemic effects in mice, anti-inflammatory and pain relieving properties, reduced oxidative stress, anti-gene mutation properties, and inhibition of liver cancer cells[5](https://www.enviromedica.com/wellness/benefits-medicinal-mushrooms/#easy-footnote-bottom-5-4261)

Summary of the benefits of Chaga:

* Mental health
* Energy
* Anti-tumor
* Detoxifies
* Boosts digestion, improves the appetite
* Purifies the blood
* Regulates blood sugar
* Strengthens the heart
* Modulates the immune system
* [Effective prebiotic](https://www.enviromedica.com/learn/prebiotics/#text-sec-7)

**Cordyceps**

[](<>)[](<>)[](<>)[](<>) Cordyceps have a large variety of medicinal effects and Chinese practitioners have used them as medicine for hundreds of years. Cordyceps grow on moth larvae, and have a symbiotic relationship with their host.[6](https://www.enviromedica.com/wellness/benefits-medicinal-mushrooms/#easy-footnote-bottom-6-4261)Traditionally, cordyceps were only used by the very few people who could afford it. They were used for the treatment of asthma, erectile dysfunction, and as a health tonic for the elderly. The main health benefit from cordyceps is increased energy because they help to deliver oxygen to the body at a cellular level. Due to their ability to increase metabolic efficiency, many athletes utilize cordyceps for increased efficiency of energy metabolism.[7](https://www.enviromedica.com/wellness/benefits-medicinal-mushrooms/#easy-footnote-bottom-7-4261)In a 12 week study[8](https://www.enviromedica.com/wellness/benefits-medicinal-mushrooms/#easy-footnote-bottom-8-4261)done on healthy older adults, cordycep use was associated with a 10.5% increase in metabolic threshold. The researchers concluded that supplementation with cordyceps improves exercise performance, and might contribute to wellness in healthy older subjects. Cordyceps are also used in treatment for asthma, cancer and diabetes.[9](https://www.enviromedica.com/wellness/benefits-medicinal-mushrooms/#easy-footnote-bottom-9-4261)

Summary of the benefits of cordyceps:

* Hydration
* Increased oxygen to cells
* Breaks down phlegm
* Anti-fatigue
* Antioxidant
* Immune modulation
* Heart tonic
* Sexual tonic
* Kidney function improvement
* Anti-viral

**Reishi**

[](<>) In Ancient Chinese medicine Reishi is referred to as the “spirit herb”, known for its ability to improve mind, body and spirit. Reishi is also known as the mushroom of long life. The Reishi mushroom contains several bioactive compounds. These compounds include specific polysaccharides, with triterpene being one of the active polysaccharide compounds of Reishi mushroom. It possesses potent anti-inflammatory, anti-tumorigenic and hypolipidemic properties. Triterpenes from Reishi are associated with cancer cell death as well. Ganoderic acid is an important triterpene component which has shown inhibitory properties on cancer.[10](https://www.enviromedica.com/wellness/benefits-medicinal-mushrooms/#easy-footnote-bottom-10-4261)Reishi is also associated with toning the blood, reducing phlegm, eradicating coughing and wheezing, strengthening the visceral organs, and promoting restful sleep.

[](<>) In one study[11](https://www.enviromedica.com/wellness/benefits-medicinal-mushrooms/#easy-footnote-bottom-11-4261)on a very aggressive form of breast cancer, reishi selectively reduced cancer cell viability and invasion, as well as the expression of key proteins involved in the pathogenesis of breast cancer cells. Reishi downregulated the expression of cancer cells on over 10 different pathways.

Summary of the benefits of Reishi:

* Anti-tumor
* Boost digestion
* Stops coughing and wheezing
* Boosts immune function
* Increases oxygenation of the cells
* Calming, restful sleep
* Reduce anxiety, depression, and paranoia

Medicinal mushrooms are only new to the world of Western medicine, and have a long history of therapeutic use. Up until recently, Western medicine had not incorporated these amazing mushrooms, but as a new medical paradigm emerges, the introduction of these mushrooms to the masses will continue to prove how extremely beneficial they are for a variety of health conditions.

### How can I strengthen my immune system?

Your first line of defense is to[choose a healthy lifestyle](http://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/six-ways-you-can-help-your-immune-system). Following general good-health guidelines is the single best step you can take toward naturally keeping your immune system strong and healthy. Every part of your body, including your immune system, functions better when protected from environmental assaults and bolstered by healthy-living strategies such as these:

* [Don't smoke.](http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/light-and-social-smoking-carry-cardiovascular-risks)
* Eat a diet high in fruits and vegetables.
* Exercise regularly.
* Maintain a[healthy weight.](http://www.health.harvard.edu/diet-and-weight-loss/bmi-calculator)
* If you drink alcohol, drink only in moderation.
* Get adequate sleep.
* [Take steps to avoid infection](http://www.health.harvard.edu/how-to-prevent-infections), such as washing your hands frequently and cooking meats thoroughly.
* Try to minimize stress.



Why is sauna bathing good for the immune system?

Sauna bathing with periods of body cool-down can help by strengthening the immune system. There are indications that the white blood cells in your body can increase as a result of the heat in a sauna. Specially in trained athletes. White cells are very important for fighting off infections that are trying to bring harm to the body.

There are also other changes that are taking place in your body as you sit and enjoy the warmth and comfort in a sauna. These changes are in respect to your T cells and antibodies. Some people say that even when they are suffering from a cold they find some time in the sauna helps to improve their condition. This is thought to be because microbes causing the ailment don't like the heat and tend to die off at higher temperatures.

Sweating flushes the body from toxins and infections by improving lymphatic drainage and blood circulation.  Both the traditional and infrared sauna kill pathogens due to heat.

**What vitamines can help the immune system?**

**Vitamin C**is one of the biggest immune system boosters of all. In fact, a lack of vitamin C can even make you more prone to getting sick. Foods rich in vitamin C include oranges, grapefruits, tangerines, strawberries, bell peppers, spinach, kale and broccoli. Daily intake of vitamin C is essential for good health because your body doesn’t produce or store it. The good news is that vitamin C is in so many foods that most people don’t need to take a vitamin C[supplement](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/5-vitamins-you-might-be-overdoing/)unless a doctor advises it.

“High doses of vitamin C may contribute to the formation of kidney stones, as well as severe diarrhea, nausea, and gastritis,” says McGowan. In a study published in February 2013 in*JAMA Internal Medicine,*men who consumed more than seven vitamin C supplements — typically containing 1,000 mg per tablet — per week had double the risk of[kidney stones](https://www.everydayhealth.com/kidney-stones/guide/). ([11](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/1568519)) “The increased risk was seen only in people taking extra doses of vitamin C and not in people taking just a multivitamin,” says McGowan. The study authors note that the risk may not apply to women, who generally have a lower risk of kidney stones. (11)

For most healthy individuals, the body can only hold and use about 200 to 250 mg of vitamin C a day, and any excess is lost through urine

* **Vitamin B6**is vital to supporting biochemical reactions in the immune system. Vitamin B6-rich foods include chicken and cold water fish such as salmon and tuna. Vitamin B6 also is found in green vegetables and in chickpeas, which is the main ingredient in hummus.
* **Vitamin E**is a powerful antioxidant that helps the body fight off infection. Foods rich in vitamin E include nuts, seeds and spinach.

### **What isMELATONINused for ?**

### ANTIOXIDANT

**Melatonin**has long been known to be a pervasive**scavenger of free-radicals**and protector against oxidative damage, but its role as an indirect antioxidant doesn’t stop there. For the most part, antioxidant enzymes are**regulated**depending on the oxidant status of the cell. However, melatonin has been found to have an influence on both cellular mRNA levels for these enzymes as well as**antioxidant enzyme activity**.

**Over the years**it has been determined that many disease states are either directly due to, or exacerbated by,**high oxidative stress**. In these situations, melatonin has proven to be an effective means of**reducing the severity**of disease and/or being a protectant against a vast array of conditions. As an indirect antioxidant, melatonin boosts activity of glutathione peroxidase – an enzyme family expressed in nearly all mammalian tissues whose primary role is protecting against oxidative damage. In fact, melatonin has shown an aptitude for**stimulating gene expression**for a variety of other antioxidant enzymes, as well as inhibiting the expression of genes such as ALA-S ([Aminolevulinic acid synthase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aminolevulinic_acid_synthase)).

**These benefits**drove researchers to begin testing melatonin as a possible therapeutic agent in**neurodegenerative diseases**. Needless to say, melatonin didn’t disappoint.

### NEUROPROTECTIVE AGENT

**Taking its**protective effects to the next level, melatonin has been found to assist in neurodegenerative diseases such as[Alzheimer’s](http://bit.ly/154W1Eg)& Parkinson’s, to protect against**excitotoxicity**, lower neural damage due to porphyria, reduce injury from ischemia-reperfusion (damage due to lack of oxygen), and protect against a variety of neural toxins. In fact, Alzheimer’s research pairing melatonin with varying blends of nutrients and activities found that the combination of**melatonin plus physical exercise**had a synergistic effect against numerous aspects of the disease – making significant headway in the battle against**[cognitive impairment](http://bit.ly/12Ru4NL)**.

These neuroprotective components are enhanced even further by melatonin’s versatility as an**anti-inflammatory**and anti-apoptotic agent (preventative against programmed cell-death). In a study from 2010, it was even tested as a means of preventing methamphetamine-induced**cell degradation and death (necrosis)**, in which the results showed how truly effective melatonin is as a neuroprotectant.

### ABOVE & BEYOND

**The list of**melatonin’s capabilities continues to expand as time carries on and technology allows for**further**, in-depth exploration.The following are additional**attributes**of this**hormone**:

* **Protects against UV and radiation damage**
* Helps regulate the[immune system](http://bit.ly/ZrWzTk)
* Required for dilation and contraction of blood vessels
* Has been[explored](http://bit.ly/11nfScM)as a means to help fight obesity
* Regulates hormone release
* **Essential for reproduction, fertility and sexual maturation**
* Used in treatment as well as prevention of various forms of cancer (*[1](http://bit.ly/129drNn),[2](http://bit.ly/17uczHa),[3](http://bit.ly/1aFRvSL),[4](http://bit.ly/1eos1uV)*)
* Beneficial in treatment of numerous conditions*
* Beneficial for maintaining balanced gut flora
* Has analgesic and sedative properties
* **Anti-aging & longevity supplement**

**Many of**these items can be linked back to melatonin’s foundational role as a**sleep promoter**, free-radical scavenger, indirect antioxidant, and regulatory hormone, which should underscore just how basic and**fundamental**it is to health and well-being.

How can probiotics help my immune system?

# [](<>) Probiotics (live micro-organisms)has shown effects in studiesto prevent upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) (for example, the common cold).

Bacteria like Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria have been shown to improve gut health and immunity.

Some probiotics (live micro-organisms) can confer a health benefit to the patient when administered in adequate amounts. Lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria are the most common types of probiotics. They are commonly consumed insauerkraut, kimchi, kefir and fermented

dairy.

Probiotics were found to be better than placebo in reducing the number of participants experiencing episodes of acute URTI by about 47% and the duration of an episode of acute URTI by about 1.89 days. Probiotics may slightly reduce antibiotic use and cold-related school absence. Side effects of probiotics were minor and gastrointestinal symptoms were the most common.

**Quality of the evidence**

The quality of the evidence is low or very low mainly due to poorly conducted trials, for example with unclear randomisation method and blinding. Some trials were supported by manufacturers of the tested probiotics and some trials had a very small sample size.

**Conclusion**

Overall, we found probiotics to be better than placebo in preventing acute URTIs. However, more trials are needed to confirm this conclusion.

## How to avoid getting sick on a plane

## Avoid using the bathroom on short flights

If it’s a short flight, make sure you go to the bathroom before your flight takes off, New York-based primary care physician[Dr. Marina Gafanovich](https://www.mynycdoctor.com/)told TPG. Why?

“You have to understand that many people are sharing that bathroom,” she said. “And research suggests that there are significant germs on sinks, flush handles and toilet seats on airplane bathrooms. That is why it’s best to use paper towels when you touch the toilet seat or faucet or even the door latch.”

## Stay hydrated

Onboard air humidity is about 15%, whereas we’re used to between 30% and 60% humidity on land. The very low humidity of the cabin air can dry out the mucous membranes of your nose and airways.

When these tissues dry out, they are much more susceptible to viruses and bacteria. To combat this, stay hydrated. “Bring your own bottle of water and aim to drink eight ounces of water per hour you’re in the air to maintain your hydration,” said Dr. Nathan Favini, medical lead at[Forward](https://goforward.com/), a new technology-based health care startup. “Alcohol and caffeine will dehydrate you even more, so save the cocktails and coffee for your destination.”

## Keep your hands clean

We all know that washing our hands is key to preventing sickness, but it’s especially true when traveling.

“Keep your hands clean,” said Dr. Nicholas Testa, chief physician executive at[Dignity Health](https://www.dignityhealth.org/socal)in Southern California. “This means a combination of good hand hygiene with either soap or water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.”

The CDC recommends an alcohol-based[hand sanitizer](https://thepointsguy.com/guide/10-gifts-for-10-or-less/)with 60% to 95% alcohol content.

## Avoid Certain Areas of the Plane

In addition to washing your hands, you should be cognizant of those areas on a plane that are particularly high touch and[infrequently cleaned](https://thepointsguy.com/guide/how-often-planes-are-cleaned/). The flu virus, for example, can live on any hard surface for up to 24 hours.

Disinfect the seat belt buckle, armrests, remote control, touch screen, tray table, and overhead air vent buttons with a disinfectant wipe before you touch them.

## Don’t touch your face

Even if your hands are clean, it’s best to keep them away from your face, too. “Even if your hands have touched the[dirtiest, germiest surfaces](https://thepointsguy.com/news/these-are-the-dirtiest-surfaces-inside-an-airplane/), you won’t get sick from that unless you bring those germs to a point of entry (nose, mouth, eyes),” said New York state-based Dr. Frank Contacessa. “Get in the habit of never rubbing your eyes, touching your mouth or your nose unless you just washed your hands. This is one of the greatest ways to avoid getting sick.”

## Choose your seat carefully

On an airplane, studies have shown that the[aisle seats](https://thepointsguy.com/guide/maneuvering-aisle-airplane-travel-etiquette/)experience significantly more traffic and run a greater risk of exposure. Why? Well, sick patients tend to brace themselves on those seats when walking to the bathroom. “The window seat is a better selection if you want to minimize the risk of[respiratory transmission](https://thepointsguy.com/news/how-to-avoid-common-travel-ailments/),” said Dr. Testa. These seats generally don’t have as much contact with passengers.

## Keep Your Air Vent On

While you might think that sitting in recycled air for hours could cause you to be sick, keeping your air vent on can actually prevent it.

“There’s been some research that showed that using the overhead air vent, directed straight downward, can create a cone of protection,” said Dr. Contacessa. “It can actually prevent airborne germs from getting close to you. The airflow from the vent can help to ward off another passenger’s sneeze germs.”

In fact, high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters found on planes remove at least 99.97% of any airborne viruses and bacteria. That air is also getting refreshed about 20 times per hour. An office only gets refreshed about 10 times.

## Do Some Health Prep

Before you even set foot on a plane, you can start preventive measures to avoid getting sick. “Start a regime of probiotics to keep the gut from holding onto bad bacteria and encouraging the body to fight infection by increasing the good bacteria in your gut,” said Dr. Testa. “Take a zinc supplement and get the flu vaccine two to three weeks prior to travel.”

Am I protected from the corona virus with a face mask ?

No. Surgical masks cannot filter fine particles less than 2 microns (0.002mm) in diameter. N95 respirators are better they filter out particles down to 0.3 microns but the corona virus measures 0.12 microns in diameter.

Can black tea help against virus and colds?

**BLACK TEA**is rich in a group of pathogen-fighting compounds that can protect against\
a variety of viral infections. Tea leaves contain naturally occurring compounds, including polyphenols, catechins and alkaloids like caffeine, theobromine and theophylline that defend the plants against invading pathogens such as bacteria, fungi and viruses. Older studies show black tea can almost completely inhibit the infectivity of influenza virus. And in one study, black tea extract, rich in flavanol compounds called theaflavins, inhibited herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) infection.

Can shiitake mushrooms help against virus?

**SHIITAKE MUSHROOMS**are loaded with beta-glucans, antiviral compounds that have been shown to inhibit viral replication and enhance immune function. In one study, people who ate shiitake mushrooms for four weeks showed improved markers of immunity, as well as reduced inflammation. Other studies show shiitake mushrooms also have significant antibacterial and antifungal properties, and they protected against 85% of the yeasts, molds and other organisms they were tested on.

**Why eatGINGER?**

has long been used in traditional medicine to treat colds and flu, and modern studies show it has measurable antiviral benefits. In one study, fresh ginger protected against HRSV (human respiratory syncytial virus, a major cause of lower respiratory tract infections) by blocking the virus’ ability to attach to cells and stimulating the release of compounds that help counteract viral infections.

Ginger contains more than 400 chemical compounds, but researchers believe the gingerol compounds are the ones responsible for the root’s health benefits. ([5](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/grp/2015/142979/)) They’re also responsible for its smell and flavor. Gingerol has powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that can help the body in a variety of different ways.

### **Reduces Inflammation**

Ginger is sometimes taken as a supplement for[rheumatoid arthritis](https://www.everydayhealth.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/guide/)and[osteoarthritis](https://www.everydayhealth.com/osteoarthritis/guide/)(two painful conditions causing joint damage). Since ginger is an anti-inflammatory, it may also be able to ease joint pain due to inflammation from arthritis.

An older study found that people with knee osteoarthritis who took ginger extract had less pain and used less pain medication. But they did experience some mild stomach upset because of the higher concentration of ginger extract. ([8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11710709))

More recent research has focused on applying ginger extract to the skin of the painful joint. ([9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26591397)) Topical ginger treatments may be effective in reducing arthritis pain without causing the side effects. ([10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4230973/))

### **Shortening or Preventing the Common Cold**

We often think of orange juice as the go-to drink for warding off a cold, but fresh ginger juice may be a better choice. The root has a warming effect, which is believed to help with[cold symptoms](https://www.everydayhealth.com/flu/guide/symptoms/). Drinking ginger can keep you warm, while also helping the body sweat and get rid of infections. (4)

In addition to its many other benefits, gingerol might help prevent infections. ([17](https://www.google.com/search?q=Nat+Prod+Commun.&oq=Nat+Prod+Commun.&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.555j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)) One study found fresh ginger may be effective against the respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), a common cause of cold-like symptoms and respiratory infections. ([18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23123794))The ginger compounds gingerol and shogaol may help fight off a cold because they can lower a[fever](https://www.everydayhealth.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/symptoms/essential-facts-about-adult-fevers/), reduce pain, and suppress a cough. ([19](http://www.ijddr.in/drug-development/cold-and-flu-conventional-vs-botanical--nutritional-therapy.php?aid=5561))

Mashhadi, N. et al. (2013). Anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects of ginger in health and physical activity: review of current evidence. International Journal of Preventive Medicine 4 (Suppl 1): S36–S42.

**GARLIC**contains powerful compounds, including allicin, diallyl trisulfide and ajoene, that fight viruses, including influenza, rhinovirus, cytomegalovirus (a type of herpes virus), herpes simplex, HIV, viral pneumonia and rotavirus. In one study, people who took allicin extract over a 12-week period had significantly fewer colds than the placebo group, and those who did get a cold recovered faster.

**What is elderberry?**

The elderberry plant is native to Europe, though it also grows in other parts of the world. It’s been used in folk medicine for centuries to treat cold and flu viruses. There are a slew of different elderberry plants, but the flowers and berries from one in particular –*Sambucus nigra*, or European elder – are the most studied. Elderberry extract, the form often seen in cold and flu remedies, relies on a combination of alcohol, or other chemicals to draw out the beneficial parts of the plant. This results in a more concentrated product.

**Does elderberry really work?**

It’s not clear. Proponents believe elderberry-based teas, lozenges and supplements provide needed antioxidants that boost the body’s natural immune response. A few studies suggest that elderberry may help reduce the duration and severity of cold and flu.

Dating back to 2004, a*[study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15080016)*of 60 adults published in*The Journal of Internal Medicine Research*reported that people who sipped 15 mL of elderberry syrup four times daily for five days shortened the duration of their illness by four days compared to those who took a placebo syrup.

A 2016*[study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4848651/)*published in the journal*Nutrients*found that air travelers who dosed themselves with elderberry syrup had a shorter and less intense illness compared to those who didn’t.

Bottom line: These studies are small, and there’s no evidence to suggest that elderberry prevents a cold or flu from taking hold. More research is needed to determine whether it’s a safe and effective remedy for – or defense against – cold and flu viruses.

**What should I look for on labels?**

Pay attention to ingredient lists to see what manufacturers are adding to the supplement. In most cases, these products (especially elderberry gummies, syrups and lozenges) contain a lot of additives.

**Is there anyone who should NOT try elderberry?**

There are some potential side effects of elderberry, so talk to your health care provider first to make sure they’re okay for you. This is especially important if you’re pregnant or lactating. Elderberry can increase the effects of diuretics or*[diabetes](https://www.henryford.com/blog/2016/11/coping-diabetes-diagnosis)*medications. It can also support or boost the immune system. While that’s usually a good thing, if you have an overactive immune system, an autoimmune disorder or you’re taking medications to suppress your immune system, elderberry could pose a problem.

**Licorice root,**used for centuries in Chinese medicine, is rich in dozens of plant compounds with antiviral and antimicrobial activities. Two compounds, glycyrrhizin (GL) and glycyrrhizic acid (GA), protect against herpes, HIV, hepatitis, coxsackie, enterovirus and SARS coronavirus. Other studies show licorice root significantly inhibits human respiratory virus and the flu.

**Oregano oil,**is a superconcentrated form of carvacrol, a powerful antiviral compound. In one study, oregano oil was effective in inhibiting five of eight viruses examined, including human respiratory virus and herpes simplex. It also has powerful antibacterial activities, especially against*E. coli*and other food-borne pathogens.

## What is influenza?

Influenza, or flu, is a highly contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. There are two main types of influenza virus that cause infection in humans - types A and B - and many sub-types or strains. Flu can occur throughout the year but influenza activity usually peaks in winter.

Flu is a vaccine-preventable illness but a new vaccine needs to be given each year because influenza viruses change (mutate) constantly. A new flu vaccine is prepared each year to best match the strains predicted for the coming flu season.
