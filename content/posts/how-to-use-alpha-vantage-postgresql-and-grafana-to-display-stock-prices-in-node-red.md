Install PostgresSQL on Windows

When creating password do not use characters like _"+>< probably best to use A to Z
and numbers. Otherwise it will not be possible to install the software. 
I figured it out after hours of reinstallation and using different configurations. 
If you fix the password then it is only important to have administrators rights when 
running the installation and it should work without any problems.
