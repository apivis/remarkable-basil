This is a flow that loads emails from a mailbox at yandex, filters the mails on the date, translates the email if it is in Swedish to English and then does sentiment analysis with the Google language API. 

Nodes that has to be installed to use this flow:

* node-red-contrib-html-to-text
* node-red-node-email
* node-red-contrib-filter
* node-red-contrib-google-cloud (translate and sentiment)
* node-red-contrib-mail-actions

If the sentiment score is lower than -0.3 the email will be placed in the mail folder Urgent. The magnitude would also be good to check as messages that include both + and - sentiment scores can cancel each other out giving an overall score of 0. A high magnitude can indicate that. The date filtering is done to prevent too many emails when testing.

The flow is started by clicking on the first node which is an inject node. This could be changed to have it triggered in a time interval instead and the mail node, set to only get the latest unread emails.

For the setup of Google cloud nodes you can follow the excellent *[instructions](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/node-red-contrib-google-cloud)* at the github for the node-red-contrib-google-cloud node.

Copy the flow below and import it to your apivis editor.
