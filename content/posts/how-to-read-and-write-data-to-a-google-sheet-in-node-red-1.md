Take the ID part from the https link of the spread sheet.

The link looks similar to this: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C_F7--lWjn1Q3dzkNIcU66NoalhSXL3HPvsIxEUFXo0/edit#gid=0

Here the ID is 1C_F7--lWjn1Q3dzkNIcU66NoalhSXL3HPvsIxEUFXo0 which should be copied to the ID field in the node configuration in the node-red editor.

![](/images/15_conf_gsheet_node.png)

When you have the Google sheet open click on the share button in the upper right corner. In the people field put in the email address that you copied from Service account details and click ready.

![](/images/16_share_email.png)

Now you should be able to read and write to the Google sheet.

In the node-red editor there is an error message: "Missing VISEO Bot Maker key - Read the documentation.".  This will not stop the flow from working. 

A key can be created at the VISEO github and activated in the editor. This is only used for collecting user statistics so they understand how the plugin are used. I have't figured out yet how to set this key as the documentation does't mentioned how to do it.
